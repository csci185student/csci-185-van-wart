What corrections did you have to make, and how did you make them?
    I had to add alt text to the album, tracks, and artist images. I also had to add the language to the html tag.
    I also had to add an aria label to the search bar input.
Is this interface functional without the use of a mouse (i.e., just using keyboard keys)? Why or why not?
    The interface works to navigate the various elements using tab and enter. However, the tab goes to the albums
    right after the artist instead of going to the tracks. it could be improved by having the tab go straight to the
    tracks after the artist.
What are other accessibility tests or features you added or would be interested in learning about?
    I would be interested in learning how to fix the above issue.
